**[1-square.py](1-square.py)** - a class Square that defines a square by private instance attribute size

**[2-square.py](2-square.py)** - a class Square that defines a square by private instance attribute size and checks for correct size input

**[3-square.py](3-square.py)** - a class Square that defines a square by:

* private instance attribute size
* checks for correct size input
* defineds public instance area that returns the area of a square

**[4-square.py](4-square.py)** - a class Square that defines a square by:

* private instance attribute size
* checks for correct size input
* defineds public instance area that returns the area of a square
* adds getter and setter functions for private instance variables

**[5-square.py](5-square.py)** - a class Square that defines a square by:

* private instance attribute size
* checks for correct size input
* defineds public instance area that returns the area of a square
* adds getter and setter functions for private instance variables
* adds public instance method my_print that prints the square with "#" to stdout


**[6-square.py](6-square.py)** - a class Square that defines a square by:

* private instance attribute size
