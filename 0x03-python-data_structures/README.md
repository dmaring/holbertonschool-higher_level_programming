**[1-element_at.py](1-element_at.py)** -a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

**[2-replace_in_list.py](2-replace_in_list.py)** - a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

**[3-print_reversed_list_integer.py](3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)** - a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

### Advanced
