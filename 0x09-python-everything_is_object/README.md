## File Descriptions
### Mandatory
**[0-rectangle.py](0-rectangle.py)** - an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

**[1-rectangle.py](1-rectangle.py)** - add private attributes to Rectangle

**[2-rectangle.py](2-rectangle.py)** - add instance methods for area and perimeter

**[3-rectangle.py](3-rectangle.py)** - add __str__ method to return correct string format of object

**[4-rectangle.py](4-rectangle.py)** - add __repr__ method to be able to reproduce object with eval()

**[5-rectangle.py](5-rectangle.py)** - add __del__ method to print a message when instance is destroyed

**[6-rectangle.py](6-rectangle.py)** - add public class attribute to track number of instances created

**[7-rectangle.py](7-rectangle.py)** - use print_symbol attribute to return string represenation of the instance

**[8-rectangle.py](8-rectangle.py)** - add static method to compare two instances of a Rectangle

**[9-rectangle.py](9-rectangle.py)** - add class method square() that constructs a rectangle with only one argument
